# SJ-Cancellations-Analysis

This notebook analyzes Saint James Hostel's cancellations from January to June 2023 to assess their financial impact and determine whether anything can be inferred about which types of customers tend to cancel their booking.

Key takeaways include:

1) cancellations increased into the summer months
2) cancellations in June were valued at over Â£70,000
3) multi-night, guest and room bookings are more likely to cancel
